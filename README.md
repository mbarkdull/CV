# CV
This is the repository to host my CV, which I am currently making with the R package vitae. 

To do:
- Move header image so that it is centered above my name. 
- Add an additional output to HTML so that this can be integrated into my website in a less clunky way. 
- Anchor the final image at the bottom of the last page.
